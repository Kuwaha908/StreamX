This executable file is designed to facilitate communication between the Windows operating system and various applications, particularly those that require user onboarding and experience enhancements. Users generally report that it is safe and not associated with any virus or malware; however, like many system files, it can sometimes cause errors or issues, such as high CPU usage or application crashes, especially if the file becomes corrupted or if there are conflicts with other software. It is important for users to ensure that UserOOBEBroker.exe is located in the correct system directory (C:\Windows\System32) to confirm its legitimacy, as malware can occasionally disguise itself with similar filenames.
